# log-collection


There is a few types of scripts that you can run to collect some log predicates from the mac while you perform actions on the device. Currently this repo only has setup assistant centric scripts. Yes I know its not the best idea to curl a script and pipe it direct into Bash. But hey it gets the job done and thats what we want.
